# Bytebux Task - Frontend

This project is the frontend part of the Bytebux Task application.
## Backend part of this project: [Bytebux Backend](https://github.com/Rafiqul-Ala-Mahid/bytebux-backend)

## Short Overview about the project:
I've developed the "Bytebux Task" project, implementing comprehensive task management functionalities using the MERN stack. This includes creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks via a RESTful API, supported by MongoDB for data storage. The front-end features a responsive user interface built with React, enabling users to interact seamlessly with task lists, add new tasks, edit existing ones, and mark tasks as completed or not.
